                <img src="./assets/kucing-anggora.jpg" alt="Anggora Cat" class="image-cat">
                <p>Many people still have difficulty distinguishing between Anggora cats and Persian cats, even though these two types of cats are different. Soft, long, and dense fur may make Anggora difficult to distinguish from Persian cats. If Persian cats are fat, it is different from Anggora cats which tend to have a thinner body shape.</p>
                <p>Anggora cats are characterized by a triangular head shape with dense fur resembling a lion with a nose that is more pointed than other types of cats. The neck with long fur is also a characteristic that cannot be diverted from Anggora cats. That's what makes this type of cat so adorable.</p>
                <p>How to care for this type of cat is not much different from caring for Persian cats. Because of its dense and long fur, the owner must be diligent in paying attention to the fur and combing it. Anggora cats are usually sold at a fairly expensive price of around 1 million to 2 million.</p>
